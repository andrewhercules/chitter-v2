#Makers Academy - Week 6 Challenge - Frontman

Using the Chitter application we developed for the [Week #4 challenge](https://www.github.com/andrewhercules/chitter), we were asked to update the application with HTML/CSS and jQuery to make it a single-page application. We were also asked to develop an API with the list of update messages and to have our application interact with the API.

A live version of the application will be available shortly.
